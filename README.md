# Extended-Kalman-filter-for-state-estimation

Please refer to my [Portfolio for this project](https://www.notion.so/Extended-Kalman-filter-for-state-estimation-fd08ab2a4278453ab05cb0bbe836f183?pvs=4) to get a brief understanding of this specific project. 

There are two parts for the code: part 1 and part 2, where there are different measurement models.
In the directory for each part, there are codes: KalmanFilt_Part*.m, in which pred_step.m and upd_step.m files were used. The init.m file initializes all the variables and plot.m provides the plot data for plotting. 
There is also a file to calculate the Jacobian matrices that were used in the main code. A report for the whole project is also present in the repository to understand the project in detail.
